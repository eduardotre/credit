# credit
credit is an app that allows users to create an account and then fill out a form to apply for a loan.
When the project is done, it will have a daily data pull sent to the admin where he can see any new applications and the submitted forms.

The code on this project is based on the code from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.
